# SDXL-Inpainting
Desktop application to mask an image and use SDXL inpainting to paint part of the image using AI.

Features include creating a mask within the application, generating an image using a text and negative prompt, and storing the history of previous inpainting work.

The SDXL Desktop client is a powerful UI for inpainting images using Stable Diffusion XL.

Built with [Delphi](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi/) using the FireMonkey framework this client works on Windows, macOS, and Linux (and maybe Android+iOS) with a single codebase and single UI. At the moment it is specifically set up for Windows.

It also features a REST integration with Replicate.com for providing Generate Image functionality within the client. You need to sign up for an API key to access that functionality.
